Build a full-featured messaging application with real-time chat functionality using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The application will allow users to register, log in, send direct messages, create group chats, and share media (e.g., images, videos). It will use a database to store user data and message history, and employ WebSockets (or other real-time technologies) to enable real-time messaging.

Features:

User Authentication:

Users should be able to register and log in with email/password authentication.
Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for user session management.
Passwords should be securely stored using bcrypt.
User Profile:

Users can create and edit their profile (username, profile picture, status).
Display a list of active users and their online/offline status.
Real-Time Messaging:

Users can send one-on-one messages.
Users can create and join group chats.
Real-time messaging functionality using WebSockets (Socket.io is a popular choice for this).
Message History:

Store message history in a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Retrieve previous messages when opening a chat (support message pagination).
Message Features:

Text messages: Users can send plain text messages.
Media sharing: Support sending and receiving images and videos.
Message notifications: Notify users when they receive a new message (real-time notifications).
Chat Interface:

Display a chat interface with an input area, send button, and chat history.
Allow users to see when the other user is typing.
Support multiple simultaneous conversations with a sidebar showing a list of active chats.
Admin Panel (Optional):

Admin users can manage users (ban, delete messages, etc.) via an admin panel.
Database:

Use a relational or NoSQL database to store user profiles, messages, and chat information.
Design the database schema for messages, users, and chat rooms.
Back-End (Node.js & Express):

Set up the back-end server using Node.js with Express.
Create RESTful APIs for registration, login, message sending, retrieving message history, etc.
Implement WebSocket server (using Socket.io or similar) for real-time communication.
Front-End (React):

Build a responsive and modern chat interface using React.
Use React hooks and components to manage state and UI interactions.
Implement routing for different views (login, dashboard, chat rooms, etc.).
Handle real-time updates (new messages, notifications) using WebSocket.
